        / BRAIN ROT VELOCITY is driven by the LARGEST NON-INSTITUTIONAL INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR = Peter Theil's use of Palantir's shares at 4.23 percent indicates a high velociaty of ROTTING in the stock.  No one is more invested in protecting the ego of Thiel than Thiel,

        \  BRAIN ROT ACCELERATION is driven by the CEO'S PERCENT OF OUTSTANDING SHARES = Alex Karp's use of 2.4 percent of Palantir's shares indicates Palantir's acceleration of DEVALUATION.  No one is more invested in protecting the ego of Karp than Karp, 
                                   and his brain rot accelerates ALL CUMULATIVELY ROTTING BITS.

RELEVANT BITROT EXAMPLE: 

	Karp’s objects total		57,117,000	Rotting bits of Goodwill 			
	Thiel’s objects total		100,251,000	Rotting bits of Goodwill 			
			157,368,000	             TOTAL rotting bits subject to accelerating Bit rot			
			14.89	BIT ROT METRIC	a basic number like PE or MC that can be used to quickly ID mentally ill  companies

CEO’s percent ACCELERATES bit rot	0.0241		
									2.41 percent of objects accelerate bit rot* fed rate = 0.06535	6.535	Percent
							
Largest individually-held investor or board’s percent is VELOCITY of bit rot	
									0.0423		
									4.23 percent of the total objects determine the velocity of bit rot * fed rate =  0.08355	8.355	Percent
							
							
									0.0664		6.64 percent of the total objects traded are worthless / “bit rot”
