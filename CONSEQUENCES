        / BRAIN ROT VELOCITY is driven by the LARGEST NON-INSTITUTIONAL INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR = Peter Theil's hoard of Palantir's shares at 4.23 percent indicates a high velociaty of ROTTING in the stock.  No one is more invested in protecting the ego of Thiel than Thiel, whose rotting carcass infects all large holders 
bit rot 
       \  BRAIN ROT ACCELERATION is driven by the CEO'S PERCENT OF OUTSTANDING SHARES = Alex Karp's hoard of 2.4 percent of Palantir's shares indicates Palantir's acceleartion of DEVALUATION.  No one is more invested in protecting the ego of Karp than Karp,a nd his brain rot accelerates ALL ROTTING BITS.


if MC exceeds 299B enable "acceleration of bitrot"
if PE exceeds 80 enable "worst possible $PATH" 
if BR exceeds 2.5 enable "least desirable outcome for all shareholders with bitrot holders"

EXAMPLE: 
CEO’s percent ACCELERATES bit rot	0.0241		2.41 percent of objects accelerate bit rot* fed rate = 0.06535	6.535	Percent
							
Largest individually-held investor or board’s percent is VELOCITY of bit rot	0.0423		4.23 percent of the total objects determine the velocity of bit rot * fed rate =  0.08355	8.355	Percent
							
							
	0.0664		6.64 percent of the total objects traded are worthless / “bit rot” 				
		0.9336					
		1	check math =1 by computing the 93.36 checksum				
							
	Karp’s objects total		57,117,000	Rotting bits of Goodwill 			
	Thiel’s objects total		100,251,000	Rotting bits of Goodwill 			
			157,368,000	             TOTAL rotting bits subject to accelerating Bit rot			
			14.89	BIT ROT METRIC	0.1489	subtract Bit Rot Metric as a percent when computing acceleration of devaluation
