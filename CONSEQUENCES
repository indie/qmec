        / BRAIN ROT VELOCITY is driven by the LARGEST NON-INSTITUTIONAL INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR = Peter Theil's hoard of Palantir's shares at 4.23 percent indicates a high velociaty of ROTTING in the stock.  No one is more invested in protecting the ego of Thiel than Thiel, 
	   /                     whose rotting carcass infects all large holders

        \  BRAIN ROT ACCELERATION is driven by the CEO'S PERCENT OF OUTSTANDING SHARES = Alex Karp's hoard of 2.4 percent of Palantir's shares indicates Palantir's acceleartion of DEVALUATION.  No one is more invested in protecting the ego of Karp than Karp, 
                                   and his brain rot accelerates ALL ROTTING BITS.

	Thiel’s objects total		100,251,000	Rotting bits of Goodwill

CEO’s percent ACCELERATES bit rot	0.0241		2.41 percent of objects accelerate bit rot* fed rate = 0.06535	6.535	Percent
							
Largest individually-held investor or board’s percent is VELOCITY of bit rot	0.0423		4.23 percent of the total objects determine the velocity of bit rot * fed rate =  0.08355	8.355	Percent
