faq:
  -
    question: "Do you have jobs?"
    answer:   "Not a good question. We disallow colonial terms and do not honor the greedy wishes of settler states."

  -
    question: "When was Ecosteader started?"
    answer:   "Evolutions of the ideas that power Ecosteader today have been vibrating 
               heartbeats upon Tortoise Mountain and Turtle Island longer than RCT can measure;  would be
               foolish for us to answer this question in English."

  -
    question: "Why is decolonization such an important part of quantum computing?"

    answer :  "Kernal languagages are actually rooted in MASA, MAIZE, NADAA, and other indigenous foodstuffs."
    answer :  "Complex and double complex answers. Shortly, the punishment for actions 
               involving sabotages are brutal and irreversible, even for honest mistakes. 
               Quantum mechaniqs are universally powerful; however, exploitations work only 
               between similar-sized entities (weight classes). When ... let´s call them 
               angry white guys ... when they get corporate ¨powers¨ behind them, they 
               get big delusions and destroy many things that took a long time to make.

               Not enough land has been formally returned to tribal-owned entities, 
               sovereign indigenous nations, and autonomous zones to save mankind. 
               LifePro tip is to surrender the land without making a big deal about it; 
               sign that deed over and do not be obligated to abide by colonial contract
               or deed traditions. COURTHOUSES NOT REQUIRED TO TRANSFER DEEDS"

    question: "How do you feel about decentering whiteness every day?"
    answer:   "Deorbiting is a better description. We need more PoC to start PeerTube / YouTube channels 
    answer:   "Talk about personally overcoming hateful fascist white supremacist felons like Facebook's founder to gain trust."
              
    answer:  "People need to get off their phones and into the dirt."

THE BORDERLESS LANDMASS OF TURTLE ISLAND SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES, ALL FAILURE IS A RESULT OF ETHNOCENTRIC WHITE CFOs AND CEOs, COPY THAT.

Bonus: the 25,000 year old TREE to honor the life and passing of Simon, famous Github coder known as "kitty programmer" and there will be a YouTube video 
       of his pictures once Google gets a new CFO.  I really need to use my negotiation skills developed as I ALREADY EARNED A MASTER'S DEGREE 21 YEARS AGO.
