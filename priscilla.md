# An Open Letter to Priscilla C

Hi Priscilla, 
  
Nobody in University studies (students or professors) decides to study, teach, major or minor in Accountancy because they "love money" 
(as Mark Zuckerberg does) ... Accountancy professionals and experts are fierce to see money as a tool enabling an audit of facts 
that emerge when we "follow the money". Over and over and over again, society sees the same tragic result of the white supremacist 
attitudes that rose to dominate U.S. politics because your college boyfriend never matured beyond a petty, petulant teenager.
It is time you acknowledge his failures and prepare him to surrender. The cost of his lies is so much greater than the benefit
of your short-term "comfort".  You know this deep down. You know that he is mentally unwell, seeking to fill that gaping hole in his
non-existent soul with superficial "stuff" that gives him a delusional illusion of success.  The truth of his rapacious attitudes
and actions mirror those of his parents and ancestors on this, the North American continent.  He is one small demon out of time, 
out of place, and with absolutely no title or right to occupy its space.

His enemies made a movie about him, and the role you got was subserviant to the patriarchy. I would have **never** had paid a 
nickel to watch the movie starring your husband's character actor. But since I had myriad IRL friends in Silicon Valley while I 
lived there, I ended up in a theater in Mountain View about 12 years ago, watching that very tragic beginning of the relationship 
between you and your so-called "business partner".  

Neither you nor that sneering narcissist who besmirched your character would have ever crossed my mind again if Mark hadn't expanded
his narcissistic tendencies to embrace all 4 of the dark tetrad narcissist characteristics that he embodies today.  Living with that 
thing must be a _nightmare_.   Everything about the morphology of your being reflects that nightmare.  You were the first "user" 
he exploited most selfishly, and today you are still locked into those heavy leaden chains. 

The lie was always that people connected to Facebook are "users".  The truth is that they are being _used_ by that hideous and 
apathetic facemash of German, Hungarian, Austrian and Polish DNA.  None of these are bad on their own, but all together, they are
a stew of toxicity that reeks hatred, selfishness, and delusion.
    
Did you know that contracts entered into under coercion (deception) are automatically invalid. Has the Chan-Zuckerberg "initiative" 
been as successful as you thought it would be when you agreed to signing whatever papers you agreed to sign to put your name all 
over his company?

Breaking news, Priscilla!  Your husband is not a "chief". He is nothing to be admired. He induces bouts of vomiting in most women.

<TBC> .
